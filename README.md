# Projects

Here are some of the key projects I have worked on:
## Biometric Recognition Processor: O1D-DWT Chip (Physical Design Flow/RTL2GDS)| Verilog, Synopsys[DC, ICC2, VCS, PrimeTime] | Oct 2023

- Designed a 1 Dimensional Discrete Wavelet Transform component to process binary fingerprint image of 16x1
- It performed decomposition, downsampling, compression, and segregation of the data into different frequencies
- Performed a complete RTL2GDS flow on this project, from Synthesis, Floorplanning, PnR to SignOff Analysis

## Custom Design of 99 Stage Ring Oscillator Schematic and Layout Design in 7nm FinFET | ASAP7 | Cadence Virtuoso (Schematic, Layout, Hspice, Cosmoscope) | Sept 2023

- Designed a 99 Stage Ring Oscillator using CMOS Inverter with 4x drive strength from ASAP7 nm PDK.
- Simulated frequency and power consumption under PVT conditions with clean DRC & LVS.

## Analyzed FinFET Device Characteristics and Simulations | Synopsys Hspice and Cadence Virtuoso | Nov 2023

- Analyzed device characteristics (IV, Subthreshold swing, Gate tunneling leakage, Temperature Inversion, DIBL, Body Effect, and Short Channel Effect) in FinFETs using ASAP7 PDK.
- Utilized Cadence Virtuoso and Hspice for the analysis.

## Static Timing Analysis of Circuits | C++ | Nov 2023

- Performed STA using topological graph algorithm & C++ STL on logical circuits in "ISCAS '85 High-Level Models."
